This textbook mainly focuses on structural, thermal, electronic, dielectric, magnetic and superconducting behaviors of materials in their solid states. This book was motivated to present those core topics of Solid State Physics in the easy way. The text has a range from basics to advanced and experimental topics in Solid State Physics. We have tried to write the text as easy as it is to comprehend with easy-to-understand figures and derivation. Majority of the subject matters of this book were originated from lecture notes of Solid State Physics courses delivered to undergraduate and postgraduate students by the first author at Shahjalal University of Science and Technology (SUST), Sylhet, Bangladesh. It will serve two main goals. The first goal is to provide the beginners, both major and non-major physics students, a solid foundation in Solid State Physics through the supplied imaginative figures in most of the topics. The second goal is to enhance understanding of the advanced and applied topics through our rigorous presentation of the text and mathematical derivations in the book.
